Grimlight are tiny LED-lights for miniatures, model trains, LARP:s and whatever else you can think of. Powered by a single CR1220 battery and switched on/off using a magnet.

* Small: 21 mm diameter, 2.5 mm at the thickest point.
* 4 different lighting effects
    * Steady
    * Flickering
    * Pulsing
    * Burst
* Small wires (0.2 mm diameter) and LEDs (1.55 mm x 0.85 mm x 0.45 mm)
* Two LEDâ€™s per circuit, letting you use them in pairs for eyes and so on should you wish.
* Light strong enough to cast shadows on the model resulting in true object source lighting
