To order stuff from us, please send an email to order@grim-light.se with what you would like to buy (or use the shop here). We will then get back to you as soon as possible with payment instructions and total cost if we have all in stock.

To cover transaction fees (currency exchange), VAT, shipping and handling we charge 70 SEK / $8 no matter how many you order or where you live in the world.

The amount of assembled Grimlight we have is a bit limited, after they run out it will probably be a while before more are manufactured.

# Grimlight

Grimlight are tiny LED-lights for miniatures, model trains, LARP:s and whatever else you can think of. Powered by a single CR1220 battery and switched on/off using a magnet.

* Small: 21 mm diameter, 2.5 mm at the thickest point.
* 4 different lighting effects
    * Steady
    * Flickering
    * Pulsing
    * Burst
* Small wires (0.2 mm diameter) and LEDs (1.55 mm x 0.85 mm x 0.45 mm)
* Two LEDâ€™s per circuit, letting you use them in pairs for eyes and so on should you wish.
* Light strong enough to cast shadows on the model resulting in true object source lighting
