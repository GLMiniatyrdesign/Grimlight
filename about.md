Grimlight are tiny magnet-controlled LED lights for miniature models.

In early 2017 we decided to simplify and innovate led lights for miniature enthusiasts, LARPers and model builders. After 10 months of prototyping we ran our successful Kickstarter during Christmas the same year.

Grimlights turned out to be just what builders, creators and ourselves had sought: A tiny, flexible and cheap light solution controlled not by physically handling the circuit but by simply moving a small magnet near it.
